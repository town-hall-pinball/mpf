        """Registers an event handler to respond to an event.

        If you add a handlers for an event for which it has already been
        registered, the new one will overwrite the old one. This is useful for
        changing priorities of existing handlers. Also it's good to know that
        you can safely add a handler over and over.

        Args:
            event: String name of the event you're adding a handler for. Since
                events are text strings, they don't have to be pre-defined.
            handler: The method that will be called when the event is fired.
            priority: An arbitrary integer value that defines what order the
                handlers will be called in. The default is 1, so if you have a
                handler that you want to be called first, add it here with a
                priority of 2. (Or 3 or 10 or 100000.) The numbers don't matter.
                They're called from highest to lowest. (i.e. priority 100 is
                called before priority 1.)
            **kwargs: Any any additional keyword/argument pairs entered here
                will be attached to the handler and called whenever that handler
                is called. Note these are in addition to kwargs that could be
                passed as part of the event post. If there's a conflict, the
                event-level ones will win.

        Returns:
            A GUID reference to the handler which you can use to later remove
            the handler via ``remove_handler_by_key``.

        For example:
        ``handler_list.append(events.add_handler('ev', self.test))``

        Then later to remove all the handlers that a module added, you could:
        for handler in handler_list:
        ``events.remove_handler(handler)``
